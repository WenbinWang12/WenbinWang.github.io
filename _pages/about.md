I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. Since 2023, I have had the privilege of joining [Data Science And Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](https://www.ncvxopt.com/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Ziping Zhao](https://www.zipingzhao.com). Before this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics with a focus on Economic Statistics at the College of Economics and Management, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China, in 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Zeyu Zhang](https://mari.hzau.edu.cn/people/people/Zhang_Zeyu.htm) on macro-economics research.

My current research interests include **Optimization, statistics, and reinforcement learning**, with a specific focus on the context of multi-agent systems where agents interact strategically.

**<font color='DeepPink'>[Highlight]</font> I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2026. Please feel free to reach out to me at - *wangwb2023@shanghaitech.edu.cn* if you would like to collaborate or discuss any of my work.**
